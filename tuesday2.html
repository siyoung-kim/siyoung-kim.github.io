	<h1>What happened Tuesday?</h1>
	<h4>Originally part of my MIT admissions blog application (spoiler: I was rejected, so here I am!)</h4>
	<p>Distant.</p>
	<p>Despite the five weeks I&rsquo;ve been here, Seoul is still startlingly foreign to me, with its brisk-walking, well-dressed crowds and incessant traffic, an uncomfortable contrast to the serenity of my more rural hometown, 광주, located four hours south.</p>
	<p>You see, Modern Seoul is a complicated being. From an urban development perspective,</p>
	<p>&ldquo;...to a discerning eye, Seoul&rsquo;s concrete jungle has many different layers. The old school mid-size office buildings nestled with machine shops, the 90s boom time skyscrapers, mixed in with post-modern works of the 21st century. All a story of an incredible development.&rdquo; - a tweet from @AskAKorean.</p>
	<p>That, combined with my nonexistent sense of direction, leads me to send a mental thank you to the HR team whenever I get off from work, as my post-work walk back to my hotel is a straight line down the main street of Gangnam, one of the wealthiest districts of Seoul, South Korea. I walk, uninterrupted, save for red street lights, my half-formed thoughts, and 강남역.</p>
	<p>강남역. Gangnam Station. 12 exits. Of those, 2 optimal choices for the entrance, 3 for the eventual exit, and in between, we have the underground shopping mall.</p>
	<p>Usually, I wear my noise-cancelling Airpods and the bustle of the crowd becomes a vague, rhythmic cloud. I enter through exit 12, where I pass a shoeless man and a dog sitting behind an empty cardboard box. My eyes idly graze, but never stall on, the trendy clothes, fast food, and masked people that blur by. My pace would be more commonplace in my secondary hometown of San Diego rather than my most recent residence of Cambridge. However, velocity isn&rsquo;t a factor in Newton&rsquo;s first law, so my left-right-left-right sequence prevails as I depart through exit 5, where I pass conservatives protesting the recent national election. I breeze by their signs and speeches without a second glance.</p>
	<p>Tuesday.</p>
	<p>I don&rsquo;t know whether I was happy or merely caffeinated, as I&rsquo;d begun constantly drinking tea at work to compensate for my lack of sleep, but not even caffeine can replace lost time. Still, I felt...not necessarily what I would define as &lsquo;good&rsquo;, but I certainly felt energetic? The last time I had felt something similar was April 3rd, according to my journal, in which I wrote &ldquo;I AM IN THE MIDDLE OF A REVOLUTION&rdquo; (long story).</p>
	<p>So there I was, four cups of matcha tea on my titt--ahem&nbsp;in my bloodstream. Airpods in, I walk through exit 12, past the shoeless man and his empty box, my line of sight floating a bit less aimlessly than usual as I draw closer to exit 5.</p>
	<p>I halt. I&rsquo;m startled. Something had caught my eye. It takes me a second to break out of my fog. I blink as I see shimmering lights and glossy colors.</p>
	<p>For those who know me well, the next part is quite predictable. That&rsquo;s right, I&rsquo;m going on an earring shopping spree.</p>
	<p>When it comes to shopping, I am so, so picky and meticulous, so of course, I go to every single earring store (five or six of them) in the station mall and vigilantly skim over every sparkling section. Two hours later, I have four new pairs of earrings.</p>
	<p>Giddy with joy, I skip out of the final store with real (non-caffeine) and renewed energy. I stride past the tiny 할머니, or grandmother, fruitlessly selling packs of sour strawberry-and-peach-flavored gum to head back to my hotel and try on my new earrings.</p>
	<p>My walk back is full of anticipation. I arrive at the hotel and impatiently jab the elevator button with my wallet to head up to my room. I change&nbsp;out of my work clothes into an outfit inspired by Britney Spears&rsquo;s music video for &ldquo;...Baby One More Time&rdquo;, a song that was released two years before I was born.</p>
	<p>I turn on BLACKPINK&rsquo;s latest song as I try on the new earrings, and for each pair, I strike poses and take a dozen mirror selfies. 찰깍. 찰깍. 찰깍.&nbsp;I look so cute! It had been so long since I had done anything fun, done anything for myself. I pick out some of my favorite photos and upload them to my small private finsta, with genuinely gushing captions about how much I loved my new earrings. My friends, thirteen or more time-zones away, like and comment. I go to sleep, happy.</p>
	<p>Now.</p>
	<p>Modern Seoul is a complicated, yet evolved being. After the Korean War ended in 1953, the city, like the rest of the Korean peninsula, was in ruins. Now, barely seventy years later, Seoul is the home of 10 million people, 20% of the Korean population. Technology is advanced. Soft power trends are set. Seoul has even grown more internationally relevant, considering the affairs of North Korea, China, and the US.</p>
	<p>Similar to the urban perspective, from a cultural, societal, and political standpoint, I like to think that the city is neither stuck in the past nor forgetful of it, that we as a society are evolving, day by day, but sometimes, it seems that the city and its people are in a bubble. A glistening bubble that may pop at any second.</p>
	<p>Sure, the COVID-19 pandemic was handled relatively well--we flattened the curve. Sure, 민주당 (the main liberal party) had a historic win in the April 2020 elections, considering both total turnout and win percentage. Sure, Korean pop music, Korean dramas and movies, and Korean beauty products are more popular than ever.</p>
	<p>But, the pandemic isn&rsquo;t over yet--there are dozens of new cases every day and recently, there's been a spike of hundreds of cases for the first time in months. But, Korean conservatives continue to question the election results, along with the economy, which isn&rsquo;t doing great, and there&rsquo;s no guarantee that the president&rsquo;s wage increases and working hour limits will save it--I think of the deserted businesses and abandoned construction works of my hometown. But, K-pop, K-dramas, and K-beauty showcase a somewhat romanticized, glossy image of Korea, despite the many social issues we still have like any other society, and the industries themselves are so capitalistic that it hurts.</p>
	<p>Sure, I had bought a pack of gum from the grandmother for 10000원, equivalent to about 8 USD. Sure, I had found a few dollars worth of change in my backpack the other day and headed back to give it to her. Sure, giving money directly to people who need it is one of the surest ways we can help them.</p>
	<p>But, is that really all I can do? But, I spent forty dollars on all of those earrings, didn&rsquo;t I? But, I went back to my hotel and frolicked around, without a care in the world, to upload only the best, happiest pictures to Instagram. But, I, just like thousands of others, ignored the shoeless man and his empty box, ignored the man I saw a few weeks ago, on the steps of exit 11 on his knees in a 큰절, the most respectful, humility-inducing bow in Korean culture.</p>
	<p>I like to think that I am neither stuck in the past nor forgetful of it, that I am evolving, day by day, but more times than not, I too, am in a glistening bubble, as I leisurely stroll on the main street of Gangnam, heading back to my business hotel after my tech internship, equipped with my Airpod Pros and shiny new earrings.</p>
