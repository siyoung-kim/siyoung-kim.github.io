# Personal Website and Blog

[Markdown Reference](https://commonmark.org/help/)

# Reminders for myself

* Apply new design
* Standardize blog post html format and then reformat non-standardized all posts (e.g. tuesday, 2020)?
* Automate blog post -> title + date + sneak peek for words.html aka blog post listing

* Resume page
* Classwork / Academics page?
