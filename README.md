# Personal Website and Blog

# Reminders for myself

* Apply new design
* Reformat images in tuesday.html, insert between text instead of the second column
* Standardize blog post html format and then reformat non-standardized all posts (e.g. tuesday, 2020)
* Automate blog post -> title + date + sneak peek for words.html aka blog post listing
