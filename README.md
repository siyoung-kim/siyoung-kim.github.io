# Reminders for myself

- Standardize blog post format and then reformat non-standardized all posts (e.g. tuesday, 2020)?
- Automate blog post -> title + date + sneak peek for words.html aka blog post listing
- Improve dropdown menu or just do a regular menu below the header
- Comments section -> google-doc-like?
- Contact me thing, newsletter thing?
- Add twitter and github icon links to bottom of page, delete github from menu
