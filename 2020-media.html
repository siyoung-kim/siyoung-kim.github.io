                Like many others during this tumultuous year, I, given far too much time on my own, turned to an excessive amount of media, ranging from books and short stories to essays and articles, from movies and TV shows to webtoons
                and comics, and of course, social media. Here&rsquo;s a review.

                I wish I could say that this was a selected list of books I read this past year, but I only read 9 books in 2020, which, sadly, did not fill my twelve-book Goodreads Reading Challenge loading bar. Full disclosure, it&rsquo;s
                actually more along the lines of 7.5 books; I included
            </span>
            <span class="c4">Dear Girls</span><span class="c5">, which I read on a plane to Korea during one of the last days of 2019, and </span><span class="c4">How to Write an Autobiographical Novel: Essays</span>

                I could be fair and correctly allocate the two books, but the slightness of the total number called for some padding. Also, the two additions fit perfectly in the Asian-American / Asian author pattern I had going on this
                past year. If I were to extend that pattern, I could say that I go by the lunar calendar and I wouldn&rsquo;t have to make any excuses at all.

                A scathing, raw essay collection. Cathy Park Hong doesn&rsquo;t hold back with her synthesis of history, contemporary events, personal experiences, ethnic studies, cultural criticism, and more. Reading this book was cathartic.
                I have a blank Google Doc to write an essay on this book because there&rsquo;s so much to talk about. I hope I actually write and finish it one of these days.

                just the one and then encourage you to go buy the book and read every word.

                accomplished, and so law-abiding, we will disappear into this country&rsquo;s amnesiac fog. We will not be the power but become absorbed by power, not share the power of whites but be stooges to a white ideology that
                exploited our ancestors. This country insists that our racial identity is beside the point, that it has nothing to do with being bullied, or passed over for promotion, or cut off every time we talk. Our race has nothing to
                do with this country, even, which is why we&rsquo;re often listed as &ldquo;Other&rdquo; in polls and why we&rsquo;re hard to find in racial breakdowns on reported rape or workplace discrimination or domestic abuse.
                It&rsquo;s like being ghosted, I suppose, where, deprived of all social cues, I have no relational gauge for my own behavior. I ransack my mind for what I could have done, could have said. I stop trusting what I see, what I
                hear. My ego is in free fall while my superego is boundless, railing that my existence is not enough, never enough, so I become compulsive in my efforts to do better, be better, blindly following this country&rsquo;s gospel
                of self-interest, proving my individual worth by expanding my net worth, until I vanish.&rdquo;

                My takeaway from this book is that we should try our best to be as understanding as possible. There&rsquo;s a lot of suffering in this world that we&rsquo;re not aware of, a lot that we won&rsquo;t ever be aware of. Another
                takeaway is that people are capable of change, that people heal and learn if they&rsquo;re given a chance. I cried a lot while reading this book.

        <p class="c0">
            <span class="c5">
                Before junior year of high school, I used to exclusively watch American and British TV shows, such as Suits, Lost, and Doctor Who, but now I exclusively watch Korean TV shows. Junior year is also when I started listening to K-pop (see <a href="2020-a-year-in-media.html#Seventh_Point_Header">Music</a>) instead of my previous staples of American hip-hop, R&B, and pop.

            <span class='c5'>
                I think that in the last two years of high school and my freshman year of college, I unconsciously sought out Korean media, especially TV shows and music, which are the most accessible media forms for me. There's definitely some sort of double miror effect here, in which the media I consume affects my identity and how my identity affects the media I choose to consume, assuming there is some sort of a choice. Now (aka 2020 and beyond), my media consumption is a bit more conscious, but still a bit mindless, hence this blog post--I'd like to be a little less clueless and a bit more self-aware. Maybe I should just start meditating again?

                Beautiful, vivid cinematography. Thematically, historically, and emotionally rich. Great, complex characters and acting. It suffers from the aforementioned drawn-out moments in slow motion that are shown from multiple
                angles, but I suppose it fits the style and storytelling. Another problem with it is the subpar English-language acting, but almost every Korean drama with English speakers is a victim of that, so I&rsquo;ll be generous with
                that as well.

                On hiatus. I miss it a lot. Action-packed. Fantastic, sharp art (in the more recent releases). I have so many questions and it&rsquo;s going to take years to get answers. There&rsquo;s an anime adaptation but I&rsquo;d
                recommend the manhwa over the anime for the details.
